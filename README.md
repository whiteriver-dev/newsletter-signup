## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass CSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Framework


### Approach
- I had a brief understanding of how React works - so my approach was to start creating elements bottom down using Atomic Design principles. 
- I began with creating primitive React components such as buttons and then worked my way up to forms, templates, pages. 
- While building the components, I would put the component I was working on into app.js so I could preview it live as I was working on it
- In the end I combined all the components together and began styling with SCSS.

### What I learned

SCSS:
- Nesting and variables
- Modular styles

React:
- Creating components from small to large
- Using and understanding UseState
- Passing props through components

### What I would change

- I learned that when passing props through components I did what's called Prop Drilling which is ok for small apps but bad practice for big projects. Next time I will try using Redux.
